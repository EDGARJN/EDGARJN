### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

"Computer vision is the science of computers and machines that can see, but what does it mean to 'see'? For a human, 'seeing' means perceiving our surroundings and interpreting the complex visual information that they provide. As computer vision researchers, our goal is to enable machines to do the same â€“ to extract meaning from the visual world and make intelligent decisions based on what they 'see'." 		**- Fei-Fei Li**

She'll write about me tomorrow. But currently **I'm Computer Scientist learning to teach machines to see and describe what they see in complex environment**
